# E-commerce-product-page

This is my first ever project that I completed after learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React from a coding bootcamp on Udemy during university vacation.

The design comes from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6) Challenges. The project was to create a simple, dynamic website for an ecommerce page.

I know that this is far from perfect and there is still plenty of fixing up that needs to be done, however, the learning process of creating a project has increased my knowledge of how to build a webpage.

### The concepts I learnt:
* The importance of creating a thorough plan and flow chart of how data will be sent through different components in React.
  * I became aware of how difficult it is sending data between 2 child components.
  * I handled this by passing a callback function into the first child as a prop and then getting the data from that child and handling the data in the parent component, then sending it to the second child component.
  * I understand this process is not very scalable for big projects and I plan to learn React Redux in the coming months as I believe this will be invaluable to helping with this problem.

* Making a responsive website with CSS Flexbox

* Using media queries to make a website responsive

* Creating animations with CSS

* Creating a responsive navbar

* Creating a responsive image slider

* Using external modules (simple-react-lightbox) and implementing them into my project

* Using the terminal and understanding different commands to improve time efficiency.

* DOM Manipulation

* React Hooks on functional components (useState and useEffect).


### What I would improve for my next project:

* Creating a roadmap of how data will be sent from different components which will improve my code structure.

* Making my code less cluttered
  * For example, for each component I would put all of the data for that component in one component file to make it easier to read

* Cleaning up duplicated CSS code
  * I know there is a lot of duplicated code in my CSS files so I will definitely do some research on how to minimise this as I progress into future projects

* Creating an event listener that when I click outside of the cart menu and mobile navigation bar they will automatically dissapear

* Learning why sometimes I will get a "ReferenceError: browser is not defined" error and how to fix this issue.
  * If anybody knows I would love to hear :)

* Testing on multiple browsers - I have only tested this on chrome so far


### Conclusion:
I am very happy with how the first project looks visibly and I think it looks very familiar to the Frontend Mentor design that they wanted implemented. I learnt a lot of invaluable lessons and it is definitely true what developers say about "learning while doing" and "not getting stuck in tutorial hell". In the future I will utilise what I have learnt to improve my projects whilst also de-cluttering my code so it is more organised as I know this is vital, especially when working in a team.
